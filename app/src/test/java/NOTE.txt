We use OkHttp library for networking

In here, we have a getForecast method that we see here, and
1:08
it's using a third-party OkHttp library to get data from the API.

the callback from the enqueue method that we define here.
1:21
And line 110 down here shows that we are setting the current weather variable
1:26
using a method called getCurrentDetails from the jsonData that's returned.
